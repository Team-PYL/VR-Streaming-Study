  <string name="paragraph2">It is situated on a mountain ridge above the Sacred Valley which is 80
    kilometres (50 mi) northwest of Cuzco and through which the Urubamba River flows.
    Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was built as an estate for the Inca emperor
    Pachacuti (1438â€“1472). Often mistakenly referred to as the Lost City of the Incas,
    it is the most familiar icon of Inca civilization.

\n\nThe Incas built the estate around 1450, but abandoned it a century later at the time of the
    Spanish Conquest. Although known locally, it was not known to the Spanish during the colonial
    period and remained unknown to the outside world before being brought to international attention
    in 1911 by the American historian Hiram Bingham. Most of the outlying buildings have been
    reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of what the structures originally
    looked like. By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored; restoration continues today.

\n\nMachu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historical Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage
    Site in 1983. In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a
    worldwide Internet poll.
